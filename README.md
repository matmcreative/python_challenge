# Objective1 | PyBank
Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. 

# Process1 | PyBank

* Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

# Objective2 | PyPoll

* Modernize small-town vote-counting process. 

# Process2 | PyPoll

* Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
